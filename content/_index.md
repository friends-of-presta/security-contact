## What do you do with the report ?

Reports are used to publish a CVE by documenting the specific details and impact of a security vulnerability, which is then submitted for official assignment and public disclosure. This information serves as a standardized reference for the security community to understand and address the identified vulnerability.

We are publishing our reshearch on the [Friends Of Presta security adivisory website](https://security.friendsofpresta.org/).

## IMPORTANT NOTICE

DO NOT REPORT VULNERABILITIES SOLELY TO THE AUTHOR OR MARKETPLACE.

We urge you to report any vulnerabilities directly to us. Our mission is to ensure the safety and security of the PrestaShop ecosystem. Unfortunately, many module developers may not always recognize or acknowledge the vulnerabilities in their code, whether due to lack of awareness, or inability to properly evaluate the associated risk, or other reasons.

Given the rise in professional cybercrime networks actively seeking out these vulnerabilities, it's crucial that any potential threats are promptly addressed and the community is informed. The most effective method to do this is by publishing a CVE.

Should you discover any vulnerabilities, **please report them to us at: report[@]security-presta.org.**

Every vulnerability report helps make the community more secure, and we are profoundly grateful for any information shared with us.
